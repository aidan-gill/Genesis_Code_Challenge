// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to put a custom UserControl in a GridView cell
// 
// This example demonstrates how a custom UserControl can be used as an in-place
// editor in GridView, TreeList, Ribbon and Vertical Grid. As described in the
// http://www.devexpress.com/scid=A128 Knowledge Base, it is not possible to just
// place a control within a cell, because cells are not controls. When a cell's
// editor is not activated, its content is drawn via a painter. So, in our example,
// we have created a painter to draw the entire UserControl's content. All cells in
// GridView will be drawn using this painter until an end-user clicks a cell. In
// this case, an actual instance of the UserControl class will be created. Controls
// inherited from the BaseEdit class are drawn via their painters, other controls
// are drawn via the DrawToBitmap function. In case of 3rd-party controls, you need
// to draw them manually. If you want to use your custom control in GridView or
// other controls, you need to implement the IEditValue interface in it.
//
